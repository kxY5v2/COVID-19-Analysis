# COVID-19-Analysis
R project to show various graphs of covid-19 cases and deaths

This project was for my Intro to Data Science Midterm. It imports a data source from the CDC and cleans the data for the programs use. 
The program plots nine heatmaps for cases and deaths from January 2020 to September 2020, as well as a line graph of cases and deaths and and a bar graph of cases seperated by state.
